If believers claim to trust God for the provision of their needs but always spend their tithes, they are charting a course for closed heavens. <\/p><p>Your actions are the measuring meter for your faith; what you do, not just what you claim, tells of what you believe. That you are justified by faith, not works, does not say you should be idle in the body of Christ. You claim to have been redeemed but your Christian assembly cannot see anything you are doing. It is time to repent. Locate where you belong in the body of Christ and let your faith propel you to action.<\/p><p>Birthday Blessing: \u201cIn righteousness you will be established: tyranny will be far from you; you will have nothing to fear.

God knew that experience is not enough foundation for the Christian faith because it can fade away with time. So before the disciples could conclude their thought, God interrupted them with His spoken word of endorsement and recommendation. Just like the disciples, God has given every believer access to His word which is meant to form the foundation of our faith. Through the word of God we get to see His light and understand His ways.

I also found fewer accidents on this narrow road compared to the broad expressway where both old and fresh accident scenes could be found on both sides.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Jesus here compared the entering God\u2019s kingdom to travelling on two paths \u2013 the broad and the narrow. The broad road is spacious and easily found by many who travel on it without pausing to think before taking it. Its end however is destruction. The narrow road, in contrast, is not plied by many because of the difficulties therein but it eventually leads to life eternal. To be Christ\u2019s disciple may not be an easy task but it is surely rewarding. Be wise in your choice-making because all that glitters is not gold.<\/p><p>Birthday Blessing: I will look after you and multiply you, and fulfil my covenant with you.

Someone once remarked: \u201csuccess in marriage does not depend on spouses committing themselves to each other as much as it does to their committing themselves to marriage, the unchanging institution that they have mutually entered into.\u201d This statement is true because marriage is a covenant and it carries severe consequences when broken by either party (Malachi 2:14).

Purity is a virtue that must be entrenched in marital relationship and this must have been cultivated from the time of singlehood. If you cannot control your sexual appetite while single, you will have problem exercising self-control in your matrimonial home. Couples must also run from deceitfulness of riches which our passage called the love of money (Hebrews 13:5).

He loves you and has the best for your life, home and the community where you live. &nbsp;<\/p><p>Birthday Blessing: \u201cDo not be afraid of them; the Lord your God himself will fight for you.\u201d Deuteronomy 3:22 <\/p><p>RBT Passage: 2 Chronicles 29; Revelation 15; Zechariah 11.<\/p><p>Faith is taking God at His Word. -- Anonymous<\/p>"},{"id":359,"post_text":"Matthew 10: 40-42","post_title":"rewards for hospitality","message":"<p>\u201cAnd if anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones because he is my disciple, I tell you the truth, he will certainly not lose his reward.\" Matthew 10:42<\/p><p>Henri Nouwen was going to a monastery for a retreat. The monks observed vows of silence and the retreat was to be meditative and prayerful. Nouwen was delayed and was late in getting to the monastery on that miserable, rainy night. He rang the bell, well after bedtime, and was met at the door by one of the brothers. The brother warmly greeted him, brought him to the kitchen and made him a cup of tea. They chatted in the late night hours but he knew this monk was supposed to observe silence, so he asked him, \"Why are you willing to talk with me?\" The monk replied \"Of all the duties of the Christian faith and the rules of my order, none is higher than hospitality.\" Many times, hospitality has to do with sacrifice. The willingness to go out of one's way to make others comfortable. <\/p><p>Jesus models a perfect example by sacrificing Himself even when it was not certain that man will repent. Jesus made it clear in today's passage that no act of kindness, no matter how little, will go unnoticed. We are therefore encouraged as His disciples not to be weary in well doing because in due time we will be rewarded. As you celebrate Christmas, think about the people you can bless around you and decide to be hospitable no matter the cost.<\/p><p>Birthday Blessing: \u201cEach of you must bring a gift in proportion to the way the Lord your God has blessed you.\u201d Deuteronomy 16:17<\/p><p>RBT Passage: 2 Chronicles 30; Revelation 16; Zechariah 12.<\/p><p>God's wonderful acts are often strange to human heart.-- T.Thomas<\/p>"},{"id":360,"post_text":"Mark 9:33-37","post_title":"welcoming children","message":"<p>\"Whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me does not welcome me but the one who sent me.\" Mark 9:37<\/p><p>The world has set up different standards to measure influence and greatness. To some, knowing the powers that be in the society makes one great. While to some having excessive wealth amounts to greatness. Jesus, in today's passage likened greatness to the ability to receive a child. Unfortunately, many adults and churches have little or no time for children and children ministry. When Jesus heard the argument of His disciples about greatness, He immediately knew that they had lost focus of the purpose for which they had been called. Their discussion revealed ego, greed and selfishness. In helping His disciples to have the right perspective to life and ministry, Jesus called their attention to the importance of children in Kingdom business. He made them realise that greatness in the kingdom of God is not measured by earthly title or positions but by exhibiting the humility of a child. <\/p><p>For anyone to be great in the sight of God, such person must be willing to learn from others like a child. As believers, we should also change our perspective to greatness. We should move away from the world's view of classifying men to God's view of honouring men. If we desire to be great, then we must be willing to serve others in humility. Remember that God honours the humble, but resists the proud.<\/p><p>Birthday Blessing:&nbsp; \u201cThe whole earth is at rest, and is quiet: they break forth into singing.\u201d Isaiah 14:7 <\/p><p>RBT Passage: 2 Chronicles 31; Rev. 17; Zechariah 13.<\/p><p>Our walk with God does not depend on people, places, things or events. -- Henry Brandt<\/p>"},{"id":361,"post_text":"1 Thessalonians 4:13-18","post_title":"wait, the lord will come","message":"<p>\u201cAfter that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.

For over sixty years Caroline Thomas keeps her promise by waiting at the train station until her missing-in-action husband can finally keep his promise with the \"lost valentine.\" She did not give up even though it took over sixty years for the promise to be fulfilled.<\/p><p>Even though sometimes it seems as if the promise of the second coming of Jesus is taking longer than expected, it is our duty as believers to wait for it. We have an assurance that God is able to keep His word. While we wait for this glorious day, today's passage encourages us to keep the following in mind: 1. Do not be ignorant, study the Word of God 2. Do not give up hope, keep trusting. 3. Keep your faith in Christ. 4. Know for certain that He is coming back. 5. Keep encouraging others with the words of Christ. Are you waiting for His return?

For the private in an infantry platoon that means: 1. maintaining a high level of fitness and robust health - so you can keep your head up and be alert even when things become physically demanding (which they always do). 2. being proficient in the use of all the weapons and equipment that you require to complete your mission. 3. Understanding the role of the army and the reasons that you are given your missions - maintaining motivation and morale.<\/p><p>The ten virgins in today's passage were on a mission that required some level of readiness and preparation which only half of them could attain. The other half discovered that they were lacking in some necessary things to meet the bridegroom. Many Christians hear and even talk about the second coming of Christ. They are keeping watch but are not actually ready. While we all wait for the coming of Christ, we must be sure that we have all it takes for us to be worthy of His presence.

There is no business man that ever has enough money. The more the business grows the more money is needed to keep and grow the business. Like the master in today's passage, God has also invested so much in us and there is a high expectation upon us God has given gifts to everyone according to his or her ability and He expects that we all put these gifts to use and make effort to multiply them. It does not matter what you received from Him as investment, what matters to Him is your commitment and dedication to the growth of the business. He knows us personally, so, He knows what is best for each of us. <\/p><p>When we look at others around us we might be tempted to think like the servant that received one talent and felt it would be a waste of time to put it to use. But we must remember that the same way the master expected return on every talent given is the same way God expects result on every gift He has given us. How are you putting God's gift to use?

However, he lost his nerve and asked for water when a lovely young woman opened the door. She thought he looked hungry so she brought him a glass of milk. He drank it and then asked, \"How much do I owe you?\" \"You don't owe me anything,\" she replied. He said, \"Then I thank you from my heart.\" Many years later that young woman became critically ill. Dr. Howard Kelly was called in for the consultation and he recognized her at once. After a long struggle, the battle was won. He requested for her bill, wrote something on it and sent it to her room. She feared to open it, but finally when she did, she read these words: \"Paid in full with one glass of milk.\"<\/p><p>Today's passage is calling our attention to the effect little acts of kindness can have. Things we do for people unconsciously will either justify us to inherit God's kingdom or condemn us. Jesus emphasised that helping people around us is the same as helping Him. Therefore, we need to see beyond ourselves so that we can be of help to others around us. By this, we are helping Christ and we can be certain of His reward.<\/p><p>Birthday Blessing: \u201cThere is surely a future hope for you, and your hope will not be cut off.\u201d Prov. 23:18 <\/p><p>RBT Passage: 2 Chronicles 35; Revelation 21; Malachi 3.<\/p><p>There is no knowing that does not begin with knowing God.--John Calvin<\/p>"},{"id":365,"post_text":"John 15: 12 -17 ","post_title":"love as i have loved you","message":"<p>\u201cMy command is this: Love each other as I have loved you.\u201d John 15:12<\/p><p>Dr. John Rosen, a psychiatrist in New York City, is well known for his work with catatonic schizophrenics. Normally, doctors remain separate and aloof from their patients but Dr. Rosen moves into the ward with them. He places his bed among their beds and lives the life they live. Every day, he shares it because he loves them. If they don't talk, he doesn't talk either. It is as if he understands what is happening to them. His being with them, communicates something that they have not experienced in years-somebody understands. But then he does something else. He puts his arms around them and hugs them. He holds these unattractive, unlovable, sometimes incontinent persons, and loves them back to life.<\/p><p>When we consider the depth of God's love to us we will discover that it is beyond human reasoning. He gave His life for us when we least deserved it. Today, God is calling us to replicate His kind of love in this world - the kind that is willing to give all and expects nothing in return. Our responsibility as believers is to allow God's unconditional love flow through us to others around. Are you willing to love as God loves? Ask the Spirit of God to empower you so that you can live for God by loving others around you. <\/p><p>Birthday Blessing: \u201c... what does the Lord your God ask of you but to fear the Lord your God, to walk in all his ways, to love him, to serve the Lord...\u201d&nbsp; Deut. 10:12<\/p><p>RBT Passage: 2 Chronicles 36; Revelation 22; Malachi 4.<\/p><p>Though our feelings come and go, God's love does not. --C.S.
